# Combustion-Simulation
Program to simulate the physics inside a combustion chamber

Begin by building the associated fluid mechanics, then energy, then species transfer/diffusion.

Use McCormack method for mass conservation equations, begin with SIMPLE for velocity-pressure coupling calculations for CFD branch.
